How to Run:

To run this application, you'll need to first install both the processing programming language with IntelliJ.
Processing: https://processing.org/
IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

After that, extract and open the source code as a project in IntelliJ.

Run the main.java file, and wait for the program to compile.
Once finished compiling, it should begin displaying the application.
From there you can interact with it however you like.
